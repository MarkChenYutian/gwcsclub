## 13.1 Acting Under Uncertainty

An intelligent agent in reality needs to handle the **uncertainty** due to partial observability and nondeterminism.

In previous chapters, agents handle uncertainty by keeping track of a **belief state** - a representation of the set of <u>all possible states that it might be in</u>.

![74c2def286635db980f08a29f1063bc](http://markdown-img-1304853431.cosgz.myqcloud.com/20210530155955.jpg)

Based on the belief states, a contingency plan that handles every possible eventuality that its sensors may report during execution will be generated.

However, such method has significant draw back

* When interpreting partial sensor information, a logical agent must consider every *logically possible* explanation for the observations - this lead to **impossibly large and complex belief state representations**.
* A correct contingency plan handle every eventuality can grow arbitrarily large and must consider arbitrarily unlikely contingency.
* Sometimes, there does not exist a plan that is guaranteed to achieve the goal. However, agent should be able to compare the plans even if they are not guaranteed.

If we are using the belief state + contingency plan technique to solve real-world problem, the intelligent agent will hardly generate a valid solution. Suppose we want our agent plan the schedule to airport, the agent may think - "we should leave at 9 a.m. , as long as the weather is good". Then, as the requirement of contingency plan is to **handle all possible situation**, it will begin to think - "what if the weather is bad", "what if the bridge falls down due to storm", "what if ..." and finally reach a solution - "you should leave 2 months earlier to the airport to get there on time".

So what's the problem with this method? By definition, we *should* leave 2 months earlier to make sure we can arrive at the airport on time in *any* situation, but the question is - do we really need such certainty? Do we need to get to airport on time even if there is an earthquake? This leads to the concept of **rational decision**.

	<p><b>Rational Decision</b> - Rational decision depends on both the <b>relative importance</b> of goal and <b>the likelihood</b> that, and degree to which, they will be achieved.</p>
</div>
### 13.1.1 Summarizing uncertainty

Suppose an intelligent agent aims to get high GPA is deployed. The agent wants to list all the actions that will lead to low GPA:

$$
Low GPA \rightarrow Low Test Scode \vee AbsentCourse \vee PlayGames \cdots
$$

It is clear that it is an almost unlimited list of possible problems that can cause Low GPA. Some people may try to reverse this logical relationship:

$$
Low TestScore \rightarrow LowGPA
$$

Which, unfortunately is also false, as not all low test score will lead to low GPA. So there does not exist a clear and definite logical relationship between $LowTestScore$ and $LowGPA$ anyway. In this situation, we need to describe the relationship between them using **degree of belief**, and solve problems using **probability theory**.

> Probability provides a way of summarizing the uncertainty that comes from our laziness[^1] and ignorance[^2]

<mark>Probability statements are made with respect to a knowledge state, not with respect to the real world</mark>. When we say a student has a probability of $0.8$ to get low GPA, we are inference based on our knowledge state, not on the real world (as the student must either has high GPA or low GPA).

[^1]: Laziness: It's too much work to list the complete set of antecedents or consequents needed to ensure an exceptionless rule and too hard to use such rules
[^2]: Ignorance: We don't have complete knowledge on most of the domain.

### 13.1.2 Uncertainty and Rational Decisions

Consider the airport schedule problem we mentioned above again.  What should the agent choose as the final result? The one that leave 2 months ago and 100% make sure you arrive on time, or the one that leave 3 hours before the plane take off?

To make such choices, an agent **must** first have **preferences** between the different possible **outcomes** of the various plans. We use the **utility theory** to represent and reason with preferences.

> **Utility Theory**: Every state has a degree of usefulness, or utility, to an agent and that the agent will prefer states with higher utility

$$
\text{Decision Theory} = \text{Probability Theory} + \text{Utility Theory}
$$

<div class="info">
    <p>
        <b>Principle of Maximum Expected Utility (MEU)</b>: An agent is rational if and only if it chooses the action that yields the highest expected utility, averaged over all the possible outcomes of the action.
    </p>

MEU is the statistical mean (expectation) of utility under best situation.

## 13.2 Probability Notation

### 13.2.1 What Probabilities are about

Probabilistic assertions talk about **how probable the situation will occur**. The set of all possible worlds is called the **sample space** ($\Omega$). The possible worlds are both *exclusive* and *exhaustive* - at any moment, there exist and only exist one world ($\omega$) as the actual world.
$$
0\leq P(\omega) \leq 1 \text{ for every } \omega \text{ and }\sum_{\omega\in\Omega}{P(\omega)} =1
$$

Usually, we won't use probabilistic assertions and queries on one particular possible worlds, but a set of them. For instance, we want to know the possibility of rolling two dices and their score sum up to 11. In Artificial Intelligence, such set is called a **proposition** ($\phi$).

$$
\text{For any proposition }\phi\text{ , }P(\phi) = \sum_{\omega\in\phi}{P(\omega)}
$$

Probabilities like $P(X=0)$ is called **unconditional** or **prior probabilities** (先验概率). It refer to <mark>degrees of belief in propositions <em>in the absence of any other information</em></mark>. In most of the situations, we do have some known information before probabilistic query. Such information is called **evidence**, and the probabilities of event **given the evidence** is called **conditional** or **posterior probabilities** (后验概率).

<div class="notification">
    <p>
        The concept of prior and posterior probability is imporant in the contents below, so make sure you fully understand them before you continue reading.
    </p>
</div>
When an agent make decision, **all the evidence it observed** will be the **evidence** and used to calculate the **posterior probabilities**.

When we say $P(X=0\mid 0\leq X \leq 5)$ , it means that - "the probability of $X=0$ given $0\leq X\leq 5$ and <mark>no further information</mark>".

$$
P(a\mid b) = \frac{P(a \wedge b)}{P(b)}, \quad\quad P(a\wedge b) = P(a\mid b)P(b)
$$

### 13.2.2 The Language of propositions in Probability Assertions

Variables in probability theory are called **random variables**. Every random variables has a **domain** - the set of all valid value a random variable can be assigned to.

When we want to talk about the probabilities of *all* the possible values of a random variable, we can use the $\mathbf{P}$ notation.

> Example:
>
> $$
> P(Weather=sunny) = 0.6\\
> P(Weather = rain) = 0.1\\
> P(Weather = cloudy) = 0.29\\
> P(Weather = snow) = 0.01
> $$
>
> In this case, we can simplify it to this form:
>
> $$
> \mathbf{P}(Weather) = \langle 0.6, 0.1, 0.29, 0.01 \rangle
> $$

The $\mathbf{P}$ statement defines the **probability distribution** for random variable.

$\mathbf{P}(X\mid Y)$ can represent the conditional distribution of $X$ and $Y$ - that is, the value of $P(X=i \mid Y=j)$ for all possible $i, j$ pairs.

$\mathbf{P}(X, Y)$ is called the **joint distribution** - which represent the possibility of $P(X=i \wedge Y=j)$ for all valid value pairs $i, j$.

A **possible world** is defined to be an assignment of values to all of the random variables under consideration.

The **full joint probability distribution** is the **joint probability distribution** with all random variable in consideration.

## 13.3 Inference using Full Joint Distribution

In this section, we describe a simple method for **probabilistic inference** - the computation of posterior probabilities for query propositions given observed evidence.

![ddaf7f6ffe19a8da0a87db7d48e3fef](http://markdown-img-1304853431.cosgz.myqcloud.com/20210601192204.jpg)

Suppose we have a domain only has three Boolean variables $Toothache$, $Cavity$ and $Catch$. The table above shows $\mathbf{P}(Cavity, Catch, Toothache)$.

The first type of probabilistic inference is to calculate the **marginal probability** of random variable, i.e., the **unconditional probability distribution** of random variable. In this Example, we can query for $\mathbf{P}(Cavity)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{P}(Cavity) = &\mathbf{P}(Cavity, \neg catch, \neg toothache) + \mathbf{P}(Cavity, \neg catch, toothache) +\\ &\mathbf{P}(Cavity, catch, \neg toothache) + \mathbf{P}(Cavity, catch, toothache)\\
=&\langle 0.008, 0.576\rangle + \langle 0.012, 0.064 \rangle + \langle 0.072, 0.144 \rangle + \langle 0.108, 0.016\rangle\\
=&\langle 0.2, 0.8\rangle
\end{aligned}
$$

This process is called **marginalization** - sum up the probabilities for each possible value of the other variables, thereby taking them out of the equation.

<div class="info">
    <b>Marginalization</b>
    <p>
        $$
            \mathbf{P}(Y) = \sum_{z\in Z} {\mathbf{P}(Y, z)}
        $$
    </p>
</div>

In the example above, we can rewrite the calculation into the "standard" form:

$$
\mathbf{P}(Cavity) = \sum_{z\in\lbrace Catch, Toothache\rbrace}{P(Y, z)}
$$

A variant of this rule involves conditional probabilities instead of joint probabilities - using the Product rule.

<div class="info">
    <b>Conditioning</b>
    <p>
        $$
        	\mathbf{P}(Y) = \sum_{z\in Z}{\mathbf{P}(Y\mid z)P(z)}
        $$
    </p>
</div>

In most cases, we are interested in computing *conditional probabilities* of some variables given evidence about others.

Using Equation $$P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(A \wedge B)}{P(B)}$$, we can calculate the conditional probability from unconditional probability and joint probability.

In the example above, we can evaluate the probability of $cavity$ given $toothache$.

$$
P(cavity \mid toothache) = \frac{P(cavity \wedge toothache)}{P(toothache)} = 0.6\\
P(\neg cavity \mid toothache) = \frac{P(\neg cavity \wedge toothache)}{P(toothache)} = 0.4
$$

During the calculation, we notice that both $P(cavity\mid toothache)$ and $P(\neg cavity \mid toothache)$ is multiplied by a factor of $\frac{1}{P(toothache)}$. We call the value of $\frac{1}{P(toothache)}$  the **normalization constant**, denote as $\alpha$.

Combining the **Marginalization** and **Normalization**, we can get a general equation to evaluate conditional probability from joint distribution.

<div class="info">
    <b>General Equation for Conditional Probability</b>
    <p>
        $$
        \mathbf{P}(X\mid \mathbf{e}) 
        = \underbrace{\alpha\mathbf{P}(X\mid \mathbf{e})}_{\text{Normalization with constant } \alpha}
        = \alpha \cdot \underbrace{
        	\sum_{\mathbf{y}\in Y}{\overbrace{
        		\mathbf{P}(X,\mathbf{e}, \mathbf{y})}^{\text{Full joint distribution}}
        }}_{\text{Remove unrelated variables } \mathbf{y}}
        $$
    </p>
</div>
Given the full joint distribution table, the equation above is able to answer any probabilistic queries for random variables. However, it **does not scale well**. If there are $n$ random boolean variables to consider, the size of joint distribution table will be $O(2^n)$ and takes $O(2^n)$ time to process the table.

To solve this problem, we will use the tool of **independence** to simplify the relationship between random variables.

## 13.4 Independence

![ddaf7f6ffe19a8da0a87db7d48e3fef](http://markdown-img-1304853431.cosgz.myqcloud.com/20210601192204.jpg)

To begin with, let's see back this case again and adding a fourth random variable $Weather = \lbrace sunny, cloudy \rbrace$.

How are $P(toothache, catch, cavity, cloudy)$ related with $P(toothache, catch, cavity)$ related? According to the **Conditioning Rule**, we can know that

$$
P(toothache, catch, cavity, cloudy) = P(toothache, catch, cavity \mid cloudy) \cdot P(cloudy)
$$

To write in General form with $\mathbf{P}$ notation

$$
\mathbf{P}(Toothache, Catch, Cavity, Weather) = \mathbf{P}(Toothache, Catch, Cavity \mid Weather) \cdot \mathbf{P}(Weather)
$$

Since we don't expect the evidence on $Weather$ affect the probability distribution of $Toothache, Catch ,Cavity$, it is clear that

$$
\mathbf{P}(Toothache, Catch, Cavity \mid Weather) = \mathbf{P}(Toothache, Catch, Cavity)
$$

Therefore, we can say

$$
\mathbf{P}(Toothache, Catch, Cavity, Weather) = \mathbf{P}(Toothache, Catch, Cavity) \cdot \mathbf{P}(Weather)
$$

This situation is called **independence**. Formally speaking, $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if

<div class="info">
	<b>Independence between Random Variables</b>
	<p>
        $$
        \mathbf{P}(A, B) = \mathbf{P}(A)\mathbf{P}(B)\quad\text{iff }A\text{ and }B\text{ are independent}
        $$
    </p>
</div>
