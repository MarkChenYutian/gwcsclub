**belief state** that represents which states of the world are currently possible. From belief state and a **transition model**, the agent can predict how the world might evolve in the next step.

![How Belief State Evolves](http://markdown-img-1304853431.cosgz.myqcloud.com/20210731142523.jpg)

From information from the **sensor model**, agents can update the belief state.

![Use Sensor update Belief State](http://markdown-img-1304853431.cosgz.myqcloud.com/20210731142629.jpg)

In *previous* section, belief state can only tell which state is *possible*, but can't say which state is *likely* or *unlikely*. In this section, we can **quantify the degree of belief in the belief state**.

## 15.1 Time and Uncertainty

In previous section, we have talked about the Bayesian Network. Bayesian network can perform probabilistic reasoning in static world. The value of random variable at each moment is independent with its previous value.

However, in many scenario, the previous state **DO** influence the current state. To utilize such information, we use a model called **Markov chain**.

### 15.1.1 States and observations

We view the world as a series of snapshots (a.k.a. **time slices** and time is not continuous)

$\mathbf{X}_t$ denote the set of state variables at time $t$

$\mathbf{E}_t$ denote the set of observable evidence variables at time $t$

$\mathbf{E}_t = e_t$ where $e_t$​ is the observed value for evidence variable.

We will assume that the state sequence starts at $t=0$ and evidence starts arriving at $t=1$. 

### 15.1.2 Transition and Sensor Models

Transition model specifies the probability distribution over the latest state variables given previous values, that is, 

$$
\mathbf{P}\left(\mathbf{X}_t \mid \mathbf{X}_{0:t-1}\right)
$$

However, this leads to a problem: as $x\rightarrow \infty$, the size of set $\mathbf{X}_{0:t-1}$ has an unbounded size. To solve this problem, we introduce the **Markov Assumption**.

<div class="info" markdown=1>
**Markov Assumption**
Markov process is <em>memoryless</em>, which means that Current State only depends on a <em>finite fixed number</em> of previous states.
</div>

<u>Process satisfying markov assumption is called <b>Markov Process</b> or <b>Markov Chains</b>.</u>

<div class="info">
<b>First Order Markov Process</b> - $\mathbf{X}_{t}$ is only related with $\mathbf{X}_{t-1}$​

$$
\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}\mid \mathbf{X}_{0:t-1}) = \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}\mid \mathbf{X}_{t-1})
$$

</div>

Beyond first-order Markov process, there are second, third, ..., n-th order Markov Process.

**N-order Markov Process**

$$
\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}\mid \mathbf{X}_{0:t-1}) = \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}\mid \lbrace\mathbf{X}_{t-1}, \mathbf{X}_{t-2}, \cdots, \mathbf{X}_{t-n}\rbrace)
$$

Therefore, in a first-order Markov process, the transition model is the conditional distribution $\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X_t}\mid \mathbf{X}_{t-1})$

Besides Markov Assumption, we also assume the world is *stationary*. At any given $t$, the transition model $\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X_t}\mid \mathbf{X}_{t-1})$ is the same.

<div class="info">
<b>Stationary Assumption</b>

$$
\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X_m}\mid \mathbf{X}_{m-1})\equiv \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X_n}\mid \mathbf{X}_{n-1}) \forall m, n
$$

</div>

During the process, we can learn the status of world through **sensor**. The sensors read from world status and give us number. Therefore, it's safe to assume that 

<div class="info">
<b>Sensor Assumption</b>

$$
\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{E}_t\mid\mathbf{X}_{0:t}, \mathbf{E}_{0:t-1}) = \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{E}_t \mid \mathbf{X}_t)
$$

</div>

$\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{E}_t \mid \mathbf{X}_t)$ is the **Sensor Model**, sometimes also called *Observation Model*.

### 15.1.3 Stationary State of Markov Model

In most cases, there exists a stationary state in the Markov Model, that is, there exists some distribution of probability of state $\mathbf{X}_ t$ such that $\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_ t) = \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_ {t+1})$

The state of Markov Model, in most cases, will converge to a stationary case.

### 15.1.4\* Improve Markov Model?

Generally, there are two methods to increase the precision of Markov Model:

* Increase the order of Markov Process Model
* Increase the set of state variables.

By increasing the order of model, we can use information from multiple ticks to calculate the probability distribution on time $t$.

Increasing the order of model can *always* be reformulated as an increase in the set of state variables.

## 15.2 Inference in Temporal Models

There are four basic inference tasks that must be solved in generic temporal model:

* **Filtering** - computing the *Belief State* - the posterior distribution over the most recent state - given all evidence to date.
  <center>$$\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X_t}\mid e_{1:t})$$​</center>
  With filtering, agent can keep track on current state and make rational decisions.

* **Prediction** - computing the posterior distribution over the future state, given all evidence to date. 

  $$
    \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X_{t+k}}\mid e_{1:t})
  $$

  Prediction is useful for evaluating possible courses of action based on their expected outcomes.

* **Smoothing** - computing the posterior distribution over a *past* state, given all evidence up to the present. 

  $$
    \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_k\mid e_{1:t}) , \text{where }1 \leq k\leq t
  $$

  Smoothing provides a better estimate of the state than was available at the time, because it incorporates more evidence.

* **Most likely explanation** - Given a sequence of observations, we might wish to find the sequence of states that is most likely to have generated those observations.

  $$
    \text{argmax}_{\mathbf{x}_{1:t}}P(\mathbf{x_{1:t}\mid e_{1:t}})
  $$

### 15.2.1 Filtering and Prediction

#### Filtering

Filtering algorithm should compute the probability distribution <span>$\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_ {t+1})$</span> from <span>$\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_ t\mid e _ {1:t})$</span> given new evidence <span>$\mathbf{P}(e_ {t+1})$</span>.

$$
\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_{t+1}\mid e_{1:t+1}) = f(e_{t+1}, \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_{t}\mid e_{1:t}))
$$


For function $f$, this process is called **recursive estimation**.

Below, we will reformulate the filtering function and find ways to describe filtering using *sensor model*, *transition model* etc.

1.Split the evidence $e_ {1:t+1}$ to $e_ {1:t}, e_ {t+1}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_{t+1}\mid e_{1:t+1}) &= \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_{t+1}\mid e_{1:t}, e_{t+1})
\end{aligned}
$$

2.Apply Bayes formula

> [Reference - Bayes Formula](/2021/05/30/CS188-Chapter13.html#h8)
> $$
> \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_ {t+1}\mid e_ {1:t}, e_ {t+1}) = \frac
> {\mathbf{P}(e_ {1+t} \mid \mathbf{X}_ {t+1}, e_ {1:t})\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_ {t+1} \mid e_ {1:t})}
> {\mathbf{P}(e_ {1+t}\mid e_ {1:t})}
> $$
> 
> Due to the *sensor assumption* in hidden markov model, $\mathbf{e_ {1+t}}$ is independent with $\mathbf{e_ {1:t}}$.
> 
> $$
> \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_ {t+1}\mid e_ {1:t}, e_ {t+1}) = \frac
> {\mathbf{P}(e_ {1+t} \mid \mathbf{X}_ {t+1}, e_ {1:t})\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_ {t+1} \mid e_ {1:t})}
> {\mathbf{P}(e_ {1+t})}
> $$

In this case, we change $\mathbf{P}(e_ {1+t})$ to **normalization constant** - $\alpha$.

$$
= \alpha \mathbf{P}(e_ {1+t} \mid \mathbf{X}_ {t+1}, e_ {1:t})\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_ {t+1} \mid e_ {1:t})
$$

3.Apply **Sensor assumption** in Hidden Markov Model

$$
= \alpha \mathbf{P}(e_ {1+t} \mid \mathbf{X}_ {t+1})\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_ {t+1} \mid e_ {1:t})
$$

4.Expand the last term

$$
= \alpha \mathbf{P}(e_ {1+t} \mid \mathbf{X}_ {t+1})\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_ {t+1} \mid x_t) \mathbf{P}(\mathbf{x}_ t \mid e_ {1:t})
$$

In a short, we can filter on $\mathbf{X}_ {t+1}$ using this formula

<div class="info">
<b>Filtering Formula</b>

$$
\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_{t+1}\mid e_{1:t+1}) = 
\alpha 
\overbrace{\mathbf{P}(e_ {1+t} \mid \mathbf{X}_ {t+1})}^{\text{Sensor Model}}
\underbrace{\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_ {t+1} \mid \mathbf{x}_ t)}_{\text{Transition Model}}
\overbrace{\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{x}_ t \mid e_ {1:t})}^{\text{Recursive Filtering}}
$$

<p>*$\alpha$ is the normalization constant</p>

</div>

#### Prediction

<div class="info">

<b>Prediction Formula</b>

$$
\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_ {1+t}\mid e_{1:t}) = 
\alpha
\underbrace{\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{X}_ {t+1}\mid x_ {t})}_{\text{Transition Model}}
\overbrace{\mathbf{P}(\mathbf{x}_ t\mid e_{1:t})}^{\text{Previous Filtering}}
$$

<p>*$\alpha$ is the normalization constant</p>
</div>

By applying transition model repeatly, we can predict state at $t+2$, $t+3$, ..., etc.

#### Case Study: Rain & Umbrella

You are in a basement and you want to know whether it is raining outside. The only information you can get is whether people get in basement with umbrella on their hands.

**Prior Knowledge**

* State transition model

  $$
  \mathbf{P}(R_t \mid R_ {t - 1}) = \left[\begin{matrix}
  P(\neg r_ t \mid r_ {t - 1}) = 0.3 & P(r_ t \mid r_ {t - 1}) = 0.7 \\
  P(\neg r_ t \mid \neg r_ {t - 1}) = 0.7 & P(r_ t \mid \neg r_ {t - 1}) = 0.3\\
  \end{matrix}\right]
  $$

  *If it rains at day $t$, the probability to rain on day $t+1$ is 0.7*, if ...

* Sensor Model

  $$
  \mathbf{P}(u \mid R) = \left[\begin{matrix}0.9 & 0.2\end{matrix}\right]
  $$

  *The probability of having an umbrella if rainy is $0.9$*. However, even when it is not rainy, *the probability of seeing an umbrella is $0.2$*.

* Initial State Distribution

  On day 0, you believes $P(Rain) = P(\neg Rain) = 0.5$, in other words, $\mathbf{P}(R_0) = \langle0.5, 0.5\rangle$

**Prediction & Filtering**

Without any new information, you can predict $\mathbf{P}(R_1)$ by applying transition model.

$$
\mathbf{P}(R_1) = \alpha\mathbf{P}(R_0)\mathbf{P}(R_1\mid R_0) = \alpha\left[\begin{matrix}
0.5 & 0.5
\end{matrix}\right] \times \left[\begin{matrix}
0.3 & 0.7 \\
0.7 & 0.3
\end{matrix}\right] = \left[\begin{matrix}
0.5, 0.5
\end{matrix}\right]
$$

Seems useless, ugh? But, things becomes interesting at the moment you receive new message: you see an umbrella so $U_1 = t$

Now we can run the filtering process:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{P}(R_1 \mid u_1) &= \alpha \mathbf{P}(u_1\mid R_1)\mathbf{P}(R_1\mid R_0)\\
&= \alpha\left[\begin{matrix}
0.9 & 0.2
\end{matrix}\right]\times \left[\begin{matrix}
0.5 & 0.5
\end{matrix}\right]\\
&= \alpha \left[\begin{matrix}
0.45 & 0.1
\end{matrix}\right]\\
&\approx \left[\begin{matrix}
0.818 & 0.182
\end{matrix}\right] 
\end{aligned}
$$

### 15.2.2 Smoothing

Smoothing is computing the past state possibility distribution given all evidence. In formal mathematical language, smoothing is evaluating:

$$
\mathbf{P}(X_k\mid e_ {1:t}), \quad \forall k \in [1, t)
$$

To evaluate this expression, we could take following steps:

1.Split the evidence variable set

$$
\mathbf{P}(X_k\mid e_ {1:t}) = \mathbf{P}(X_k\mid e_ {1:k}, e_ {k+1: t})
$$

2.Apply Bayes Rule, take $e_ {1:k}$​ as evidence variable set ([Reference - Bayes Formula](/2021/05/30/CS188-Chapter13.html#h8))

$$
= \alpha \mathbf{P}(X_ k \mid e_ {1:k}) \mathbf{P}(e_ {k+1:t} \mid X_k, e_ {1:k})
$$

3.Accroading to sensor assumption in HMM, we know $e_ {k+1:t}$ is independent with $e_ {1:k}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
&=\alpha\mathbf{P}(X_k\mid e_ {1:k}) \mathbf{P}(e_ {k+1:t} \mid X_k) \\
&=\alpha\text{ Filtering}(X_k) \text{Backward}(X_k, e_ {k+1:t})
\end{aligned}
$$

For the "Filtering" part, we can call filtering function described above. Below will discuss the "Backward" part:
